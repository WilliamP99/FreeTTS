Forked FreeTTS
==============

https://github.com/timabell/FreeTTS

This fork of freetts was created (thanks to the open source license in use) in order to republish with a bugfix for a hang under OpenJDK. Binary code mixed in to the upstream repo has been stripped out as this is incompatible with the GPL.

The motivation is to improve the capability of this app: https://launchpad.net/communication

Contributions to this fork are welcomed, preferably through github's pull request system.

FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java
programming language. It is based upon Flite, a small, fast, run-time speech
synthesis engine, which in turn is based upon University of Edinburgh's
Festival Speech Synthesis System and Carnegie Mellon University's
FestVox project.

Detailed documentation on FreeTTS can be found in docs/index.html
